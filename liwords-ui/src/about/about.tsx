            <p>
              Let’s face it, the status quo is pretty bad. After so many years
              of being inured to “average”, we realize change will only start at
              the grassroots level. We’re a group of techy word gamers with big
              dreams, and while it’ll take time to achieve them all, we believe
              we can get there.
            </p>
            <h4>Three main principles guide the creation of this community.</h4>
            <p>1) Create a great place to play word games online.</p>
            <p>
              2) Create a tool that lets people of all skill levels from all
              over the world improve at our favorite board game
            </p>
            <p>3) Build the best AI our community has ever seen.</p>
            <h4>Can I help?</h4>
            <p>
              Absolutely. Financially, you can help the team by donating. We are
              funded completely by players like you. We are registered as a
              non-profit in the state of New Jersey.{' '}

                  Although César hovers around the top 20 in North America in
                  Scrabble®, he loves coding even more than playing, and thus
                  hasn’t reached the heights he’s dreamed of because he spends
                  most of his free time thinking up and building new apps. He
                  built Aerolith, a word study app which is used by hundreds of
                  competitive word gamers, and has many years of experience as a
                  professional developer. His Y Combinator startup, Leftronic
                  (S2010), was acquired in 2014, and he currently works as a
                  Senior Software Architect at a company in NYC dedicated to
                  fighting phone fraud. He also likes biking, playing guitar,
                  artisanal ketchup, and hanging out with his wifie# in their
                  Montclair home.

                <p>
                  Jesse has been playing competitive Scrabble® since 2004. His
                  career highlights include winning the 2019 US National
                  Championship and finishing second at the World Championship
                  twice. His lowlight was playing the phony two-letter word IR
                  in the final of US Nationals, which ended up in a viral
                  Youtube video! Professionally, Jesse works in tech as a
                  product manager/data scientist chimera, which is roughly his
                  role within the Woogles project. He likes baguettes and
                  penguins and dislikes ketchup.

                  Conrad is a product designer whose work in the tech industry
                  is used daily by millions of people around the world. He
                  started playing competitive Scrabble® at the ripe old age of
                  14, peaking competitively in his early 20s: he held the world
                  #1 ranking at 22, and won the 2014 US National Championship at
                  24. As one of the word game community’s only professional
                  designers, his goal for Woogles is to craft fun, intuitive,
                  and inclusive experiences for word gamers worldwide. He’s also
                  a heavy metal drummer, beer nerd, and former food truck cook
                  (ketchup rules; Jesse is wrong.)

                  database management to derive a fascinating variety of
                  accessible game data from the vast repository of games played
                  and imported on Woogles. He works as a software developer at
                  Leidos during the day and enjoys juggling and studying
                  Japanese in his spare time. Josh prefers vinegar-based
                  condiments.

                  As someone who has been learning to play competitive Scrabble®
                  since 2002, Lola considers herself the voice of the passionate
                  non-expert on the team. She has been coding for 3 decades,
                  spending 12 of those years on her own startups. She currently
                  works as a Principal Software Development Engineer creating
                  user interfaces used by over a million experts in their
                  fields. In 2016, she was a finalist for the Women’s Tech
                  Council annual awards. Besides Scrabble®, she's also
                  enthusiastically bad at standup comedy, playing the bass
                  guitar, singing, and painting. Ketchup is gross.

                  Doug has been playing Scrabble® for over 30 years -- a
                  Guinness World Record. This makes him feel old, but still
                  dignified. Early on, his Grandma Elaine taught him the
                  importance of maximizing Power Tiles through crushing two-way
                  Double-Letter-Score plays for a whopping 20 points at a time!
                  As a teen, he discovered the club and tournament scene at a
                  local bookstore, where he was welcomed to compete responsibly
                  for $1 scratchoff jackpots against a wide range of Scrabble®
                  personalities who proved that scoring 300 points per game
                  wouldn't cut it anymore, kid. Now an expert player, Doug is
                  dizzily euphoric to be part of the Woogles team and believes,
                  of course, that all Woogles are good Woogles.

                  events for others, his goal is the same - translate the depth
                  and beauty of the game in a way that resonates with even
                  casual fans. He firmly believes that Woogles is a critical
                  component of the future of word games, and his role on the
                  team is to leverage existing platforms and develop content to

                  What exactly IS Woogles? In Greek mythology, Woogles was the
                  trusty hound of Hermes, the Greek God of word games and
                  handbags (maybe not that last one, but Wikipedia has him down
                  for "trade, wealth, luck, fertility, animal husbandry, sleep,
                  language, thieves, and travel"). Legend has it that Woogles
                  would bark in warning when a phony word was played, which is
                  why word games aren't in the Olympics. He is committed to
                  inclusivity, community, and expanding the game. He hates
                  phonies.
